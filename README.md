# Provision Assist
Provision Assist is a Power Platform and Azure based solution that provides an alternative to self-service creation in Microsoft 365. It provides governance over this process through a frontend Power App allowing users to request Collaboration 'Spaces' (Teams, Groups, SPO Sites & Viva Engage Communities) and backend Azure components providing automated provisioning.
